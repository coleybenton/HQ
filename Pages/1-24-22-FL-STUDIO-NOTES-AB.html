    <h1><u>Mixing</u></h1>
      <ul><strong><u>Quick Definition:</strong></u> Setting the levels of instruments/effects so they sound good together.
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Level, Panning, (Optional: Track-by-track Compression, Limiting Master Mixer track - Maximus/Soun)</li>
        <li><strong>Louder:</strong> Per-track Compression, particularly on the Bass and Drum part. This lowers the attack peaks and use the saved dB headroom to raise the sustain parts of the sound, which is more important for the loudness than peak level. Beware of using compression on samples that are already compressed, as over-compressing can make instruments sound squashed and muddy. </li>
        <strong>Louder:</strong> Per-track EQ to cut unwanted frequencies (relative to instrument and role in mix). 
            <ul><li><strong>Bass (less than 250 Hz):</strong> Try cutting bass on anything not a Bass instrument, and any drums that don't need much bass (snares, hats, etc.). Unwanted lower frequencies from other instruments create a "rumble" that wastes dB headroom and muddies the bottom end of the mix. Always cut too aggressively, then back off until you get a sound you like: With the full mix playing, cut the bass on each instrument until you start to notice it, then back off a little. 
            <li><strong>Mid frequencies (300-3000 Hz): </strong>tend to crowd in the mix, so cut them from instruments where they are not needed (same process as above/ for bass). </li> 
            <li><strong>High frequencies (+ 4000 Hz): </strong>tend to create an overly bright or "brittle" sounding mix, so dont be afraid to cut them back. Be especially aware that compressors can add "saturation" (high frequency distortion) to sounds when over-driven. If you do this right, instruments will probably sound strange in solo but great in the mix. We can't stress enough that we are not talking about a few dB here and there. Make dramatic -10 to -20 dB cuts, or more!</li>
            </ul>
          <ul><strong><u>dB Cheatsheet:</u></strong> 
            <li><strong>+12 dB </strong> = 400% volume increase</li>
            <li><strong>+6 dB </strong> = 200% volume increase</li>
            <li><strong>+1 dB </strong> = 10% volume increase (JND = Just Noticeable Difference, smallest increase in volume you can notice)</li>
            <li><strong>0 dB </strong> = no change (note this is not 0 dB on the scale, but the difference between two dB levels)</li>
            <li><strong>-1 dB </strong> = 10% volume decrease (very close to JND smallest noticeable volume decrease)</li>
            <li><strong>-6 dB </strong>= 50% volume decrease (half the original level)</li>
            <li><strong>-12 dB </strong> = 75% volume decrease (to 25% of the original level)</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    <br/>
    <h1><u>Mastering</u></h1>
      <ul><strong><u>Quick Definition:</u></strong> Adjusting the mix to sound both good and loud (relative to track usage/genre).
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Equalization, Multi-Band Compression, and/or Master Track Limiting. </li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Per-track EQ to shape frequencies. Think of sounds as low, medium or high frequency ranges and discard unneccessary frequencies outside their band. Discarding should be done in the context of the full mix, using Parametric EQ2 to cut freq until you just start to notice change in the sound, then back off abit. Also, you may need to reduce the cut-amount/s if the sounds are heard in isolation at particular times during the track, using automation clips on the cut level</li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Timing - avoiding dominant instruments playing on the same beat (like kick on the beat, bass on the off-beat). If they must overlap, you could use Sidechain Compression/Ducking or the Master Limiting to sort this out </li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Panning - overlooked, but effective. Avoid all the instruments crowding into the center, spread a few of them around (+/- 40% (im guessing adjusting the panning left or right up to 40) max is a good range to work in). When you can clearly hear sounds in different areas (center, left, right, in-between), your mix will sound more open, interesting and powerful. Kick drum and Bass are usually center, play around with the rest (maybe)</li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Riding the gain - using Automation Clips to adjust the relative volume of the different mixer tracks throughout the mix. If you turn a sound up to make a point or make it important, lower the orthers to make room. We can only focus attention on one thing at a time, so use volume changes to draw that attention to important parts of the mix and create drama/dynamics. Think band. </li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Ducking - some parts in response to others. Also called "lazy-mans" gain riding, Sidechain Compression (for example between the Kick Drum and Bass parts and/or Kick Drum and other dominant instruments) can be an effective solution. Sidechaining a Compressor on the Bass track to the sound of the Kick Drum track for example, turns down the Bass when the Kick plays, allowing the Kick to punch through the mix, while at the same time, preventing the kick and bass sounds from competing for dB headroom. Be careful to not use too much, as you can hear the compressed track/s pumping up and down (another effect entirely/unintended)</li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> Reverb - when used in moderation, can create a sense of space. Particularly important to lead vocals (longer reverb) and drum sounds (shorter reverb, also, think snare). Reverb creates mood as it tells
      </ul>
