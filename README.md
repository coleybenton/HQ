# HQ
Headquarters, going to start making my personal website and stuff

First let's create a list of the workout, title for the workout, log section, and more info

okay thats done:

- change font 
- organize lists and content into two divs perhaps like log and headquarters
- find a color scheme
- have wide margins with color or maybe images in divs
- a form where you can submit updates and it updates the screen
